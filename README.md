# Iris-Clustering


This repository contains code to perform clustering analysis on the Iris dataset using the KMeans algorithm. The optimal number of clusters is determined using the Elbow method.

## Files

- `iris.csv`: The dataset file containing Iris flower measurements.
- `clustering_analysis.py`: The Python script that performs the clustering analysis.
- `unsupervised_ml.ipynb`: The main python script that was generated. (Open this to completely understand the code)

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed:
   - pandas
   - scikit-learn
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn
3. Place the `iris.csv` file in the same directory as the `clustering_analysis.py` script.
4. Run the `clustering_analysis.py` script:
   ```bash
   python clustering_analysis.py
